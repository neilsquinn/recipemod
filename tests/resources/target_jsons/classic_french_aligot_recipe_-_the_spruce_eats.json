      "Gather the ingredients.",
      "Place the potato quarters into a pan of cold, lightly salted water.",
      "Boil for 20 minutes, until they are tender. Keep an eye on them to make sure they don't start to break up and become mealy.",
      "Once cooked, drain them in a colander .",
      "Mash the drained potatoes with a masher.",
      "Add the salt, white pepper, and butter, and then vigorously mix for 2 to 3 minutes until the potatoes fluff up a bit. Set them aside in the pan for a moment.",
      "In a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat, bring the crème fraîche and garlic to just steaming. Do not boil, or the creme fraîche may break.",
      "Remove the garlic, and pour the hot crème fraîche into the mashed potatoes.",
      "Transfer the pan of potatoes to the stovetop over low heat; using a sturdy wooden spoon, beat the crème fraîche into the potatoes. By now, the potatoes will start to turn glossy.",
      "Raise the heat to be medium, and beat in the cheese, 1/2 cup at a time.",
      "Continue beating the mixture over the heat until it forms a smooth, velvety texture, about 10 minutes. Do not skimp on this process. It is the sturdy beating that makes aligot so deliciously velvety.",
      "Pour onto warm plates and serve immediately."
