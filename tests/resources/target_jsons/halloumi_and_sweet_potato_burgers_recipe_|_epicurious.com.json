    "steps": [
      "Cook the sweet potatoes in a large pan of boiling salted water for about 15 minutes until just tender. Drain and cool before roughly crushing with a potato masher – don't mash to a purée.",
      "Meanwhile, cook the kale in a pan of boiling water for about 4 minutes until just tender. Drain and dry with kitchen paper. Cool, then chop it coarsely.",
      "Heat the olive oil in a small skillet set over a medium heat and cook the scallions, garlic, and chile for 2–3 minutes without coloring. Stir in the cilantro.",
      "Spoon into a large bowl, then mix in the sweet potato, kale and flour. Season with salt and pepper. Divide the mixture into four portions and shape each one into a burger. Coat in the sesame seeds, then cover and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes until firm.",
      "Heat a little oil in a non-stick skillet over a low to medium heat and cook the burgers for 3–4 minutes each side until golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towels.",
      "Dry-fry or griddle the halloumi over a medium heat for about 2 minutes each side until crisp and golden brown.",
      "Lightly toast the burger buns and spread the bases with the mashed avocado. Top with the halloumi, burgers and some chile jam. Cover with the bun tops and serve."
