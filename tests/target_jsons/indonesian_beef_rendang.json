      "Cut the beef into bite-sized pieces and flash fry in batches in a clean pan with the groundnut oil to get a bit of golden colour. Transfer the beef to a slow cooker once it's coloured to make space to brown off more.",
      "Peel and roughly chop the onion, garlic, ginger, lemongrass and chillies. Throw them all into the food processor with the kaffir lime leaves, spices and palm sugar. Blitz to a paste and start to fry in the beef pan with a little more groundnut oil for 2-3 minutes.",
      "Scrape the paste into the slow-cooker and add the coconut milk, desiccated coconut, cinnamon stick, salt and 100ml of water. Cook on a low heat for 6 hours until the beef is really tender.",
      "Finish the curry with tamarind and fresh coriander then serve with steamed rice and some freshly finely sliced spring onion and red chilli. Serves 4"
