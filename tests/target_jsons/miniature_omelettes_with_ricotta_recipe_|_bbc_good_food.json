      "Beat the eggs with 2 tbsp water, then season if you want to. Mix in the parsley, chives, garlic and parmesan.",
      "Heat a 23cm heavy-based frying pan on a medium heat with a little oil. When the oil’s hot, add a ladleful (about a third) of the egg mixture and tip the mixture so it covers the base. Reduce the heat and cook the omelette until just firm, then flip it over and cook the other side. Keep warm. Repeat to make three omelettes, adding a little extra oil to the pan each time.",
      "Make the filling by combining the ricotta, basil, parmesan and some pepper. Spread mixture over each omelette, roll up loosely like a cigar and cut into thickish slices. Can be made up to 5 hrs ahead. Serve garnished with parsley."
