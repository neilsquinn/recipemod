    "steps": [
      "Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease a standard-size loaf pan (mine is 4.5″ x 8.5″). Set aside.",
      "To a large mixing bowl, add the bananas. Using a potato masher, smash until as smooth as possible. Stir in the sugar and canola oil. Add the eggs and whisk together until smooth. Whisk in the vanilla.",
      "Set a fine-mesh sieve over the bowl. Add the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt to the sieve. Sift over the wet ingredients. Using a spatula, fold the dry ingredients into the wet, just until combined.",
      "Pour into the prepared loaf pan.",
      "Bake until middle is set and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 45 – 55 minutes (if you're using a larger pan than my 4.5″ x 8.5″ pan, start checking at around the 45 minute mark. For the smaller pan, it'll take a bit more time to cook in the middle – closer to 55 minutes).",
      "Remove from oven and let the loaf cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Use a butter knife to loosen the sides of the loaf then gently invert the pan to remove the loaf. Let cool on a wire rack.",
      "Wrap in plastic wrap to store. Bonus: The plastic wrap also makes it nice and moist. Yum!"
